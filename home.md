**Data visualization** (often abbreviated data viz) 

it is an interdisciplinary field that deals with the graphic representation of data. It is a particularly efficient way of communicating when the data is numerous as for example a time series.

From an academic point of view, this representation can be considered as a mapping between the original data (usually numerical) and graphic elements (for example, lines or points in a chart).

The mapping determines how the attributes of these elements vary according to the data.

In this light, a bar chart is a mapping of the length of a bar to a magnitude of a variable. 

since the graphic design of the mapping can adversely affect the readability of a chart mapping is a core competency of **Data visualization**.

**Streamlit** is an awesome new tool that allows engineers to quickly build highly interactive web applications around their data, machine learning models, and pretty much anything.

The best thing about **Streamlit** is it doesn't require any knowledge of web development. 

If you know Python, you're good to go!

**EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis** - does this for Machine Learning enthusiast.

It is a way of visualizing, summarizing and interpreting the information that is hidden in rows and column format.

Once **EDA** is complete and insights are drawn, its feature can be used for supervised and unsupervised machine learning modelling.

**Machine learning** is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.

Machine learning is an important component of the growing field of data science. Through the use of statistical methods, algorithms are trained to make classifications or predictions, uncovering key insights within data mining projects. These insights subsequently drive decision making within applications and businesses, ideally impacting key growth metrics. As big data continues to expand and grow, the market demand for data scientists will increase, requiring them to assist in the identification of the most relevant business questions and subsequently the data to answer them.
